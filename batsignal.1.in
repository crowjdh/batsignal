.SH SIGNALS
batsignal responds to the following signals:
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Sending the process SIGUSR1 will cause an immediate battery check to be performed.
.SH NOTES
In most cases, batsignal will perform fewer battery state checks while the battery is discharging and the level of charge is not near a warning level.
This frequency is affected by the multiplier (-m) option and is never less than <multiplier> seconds.
If the "full" level (-f) is set, batsignal will instead check the battery state every <multiplier> seconds regardless of level of charge.

If the "full" level (-f) is set, the battery full notification will be triggered at the given level of charge or when the battery status changes to full, whichever occurs first.

The message COMMAND passed with -M is a printf-style format string.
It can use two string placeholders (%s) that will be replaced by the message text and the current battery level.
Be sure to test the command - invalid format strings may cause batsignal to crash.
